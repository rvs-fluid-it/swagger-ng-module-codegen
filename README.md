# swagger-ng-module-codegen
swagger-ng-module-codegen will generate an Angular module (@NgModule) based upon a Swagger specification

The generated module is targeted at Angular2 and is publishable to a npm registry.
The generated build code is heavily influenced by Cyrille Tuzi's article 'How to build and publish an Angular module'(https://medium.com/@cyrilletuzi/how-to-build-and-publish-an-angular-module-7ad19c0b4464#.7kgg9z5pu).
